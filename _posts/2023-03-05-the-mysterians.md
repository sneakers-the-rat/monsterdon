Strange happenings occur throughout a village in Japan. Forrest fires occur from fires burning from the roots... lots of dead fish float down the streams... areas of ground to have been moved around as if it had gone through a washing machine... and a giant robot, named Mogera, begins to attack the nearby area. Soon all of these strange occurrences are solved when aliens from the planet Mysteroid reveal themselves to the world. Their purpose is to establish 3 kilometers of land - for their home planet had already been destroyed by nuclear weapons. They also want to intermarry with Earth women - for their race is dying off, due to the radiation absorbed into their bodies. Will the Earth agree to the Mysterians requests?
