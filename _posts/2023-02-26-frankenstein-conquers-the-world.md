During World War II the Frankenstein monster's heart is being delivered to Hiroshima. The scientists are trying to learn the secret of immortality. The bomb is dropped on the city. 15 years later a wild boy is seen roaming the streets - feeding off of any small animal he can find. Three scientists take the boy to their clinic and conduct research on him. The boy continues to grow until he's too big to be contained at the clinic. The giant breaks free and tries his best to avoid anyone from seeing him. Suddenly human remains are discovered. The authorities believe that the giant is responsible for these horrendous crimes and begin the hunt to track him down and kill him. Is the giant responsible for these killings?
